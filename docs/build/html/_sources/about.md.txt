# Kamodo-GEODYN Project


## About the Project

The goal of this research project is to implement and test the CCMCâ€™s Kamodo python package and NASA's GEODYN on an Amazon Web Services-hosted CCMC collaborative environment with the long-term goal of fully integrating Kamodo and associated thermospheric models into GEODYN. We will test ionospheric model interpolation in Kamodo and assist with installation and testing of GEODYN in collaboration with the developers of the GEODYN software. We will also provide CCMC-specific documentation.  The expected significance of this proposed research is to offer an easy-to-use, science-oriented orbital dynamics package for Ionosphere-Thermosphere-Mesosphere (ITM) researchers to use for satellite trajectory tracking and atmospheric drag research.  The Kamodo package further allows streamlined atmospheric model data processing for collaborative ITM research. 



## Kamodo

Kamodo is a new CCMC tool for access, interpolation, and visualization of space weather models and data in python. Kamodo allows model developers to represent simulation results as mathematical functions which may be manipulated directly by end users. Kamodo handles unit conversion transparently and supports interactive science discovery through jupyter notebooks with minimal coding and is accessible through python.

## GEODYN

GEODYN is an orbit determination and geodetic parameter estimation program.
GEODYN is a set of software tools used for orbit determination and geodetic parameter estimation. Users of GEODYN input estimates of orbital parameters (such as the initial satellite state and solar radiation coefficients) and geodetic parameters (such as tracking station coordinates). GEODYN then computes orbits from the input parameters and can also compute theoretical values of satellite tracking observations using the input geodetic parameters. GEODYN can compare the theoretical values of tracking observations with real tracking observations to refine the input values of orbital and geodetic parameters.
